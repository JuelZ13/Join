    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        <span class="jblue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management
        tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of
        their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        <br>
        <br>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly
        effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
        maximize efficiency (or flow).
        <span class="jblue">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban
        to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive,
        visual interface.
        <br>

    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
        <span class="jblue">Join</span>:

        <h2>1.</h2>
        <div>
            <span class="jblue">Exploring the Board</span> <br>
            When you log in to <span class="jblue">Join</span>, you'll find a
            default board. This board represents your project and contains
            four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
            "Done".
        </div>
    </div>

        <h2>2.</h2>
        <div>
            <span class="jblue">Creating Contacts</span> <br>
            In <span class="jblue">Join</span>,
            you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
            "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
            required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
            tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
        </div>

    <div class="divList">
        <h2>3.</h2>
        <div>
            <span class="jblue"> Adding Cards</span> <br>
            Now that you've added your contacts,
            you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
            Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new
            card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name,
            description, due date, assignees, etc.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="divList">
        <h2>4.</h2>    
        <div>
            <span class="jblue">Moving Cards</span> <br>
            As the task moves from one stage to
            another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
            dropping the card from one list to another.
        </div>

    <div class="divList">
        <h2>5.</h2>    
        <div>
            <span class="jblue">Deleting Cards</span> <br>
            Once a task is completed, you can
            either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
            will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
            when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
            <br>

            Remember that using <span class="jblue">Join</span> effectively requires
            consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
            reflects the current state of your project.
